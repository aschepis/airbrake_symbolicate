= airbrake_symbolicate

lib and cli tool to download airbrake iOS crash reports via the api and symbolicate them

Works best if GCGitCommitHash is set in the iOS apps Info.plist. (a la https://github.com/brettg/xcode-git-cfbundleversion). Failing that it _should_ try using CFBundleVersion (and CFBundleShortVersion).
